# Getting Started

On first installation:

### `npm install`

You should also configure Prettier to run on file save. Navigate to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Format on Save" and turn it on.
Not sure if it's necessary, but try to pressing ALT + SHIFT + F, it might prompt you to set your default formatter. In this case choose Prettier. If its still not working set your Default Editor manually. You can find this setting where you found the "Format on Save" option.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Recommended VS Code Plugins

In order to simplify developing with React there are a number of plugins that should be installed:

* ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native
* vscode-styled-components
* Prettier - Code formatter

Some more suggestions:

* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
* Auto Rename Tag

Note that this project uses a config file for Prettier which overrides most of the default settings so formatting always stays the same!
